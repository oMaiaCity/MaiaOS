# Shared Libraries Directory

This directory contains shared packages that can be reused across workspaces in the monorepo.

Each subdirectory in `libs/` is a separate workspace with its own `package.json`.

See `.cursor/rules/monorepo-architecture.mdc` for documentation on how to create and use shared libraries.
