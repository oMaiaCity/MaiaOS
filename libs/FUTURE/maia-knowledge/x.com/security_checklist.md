The SINKING SHIP checklist :

Run this before you ship anything built with AI.

SECURITY
[ ] No API keys or secrets in frontend code
[ ] Every route checks authentication (audit all endpoints, not just the obvious ones)
[ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere, HTTP redirected
[ ] CORS locked to your domain — not wildcard
[ ] Input validated and sanitized server-side
[ ] Rate limiting on auth and sensitive endpoints
[ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt or argon2
[ ] Auth tokens have expiry
[ ] Sessions invalidated on logout (server-side)

DATABASE
[ ] Backups configured and tested (test restore, not just backup)
[ ] Parameterized queries everywhere — no string concatenation
[ ] Separate dev and production databases
[ ] Connection pooling configured
[ ] Migrations in version control, not manual changes
[ ] App uses a non-root DB user

DEPLOYMENT
[ ] All environment variables set on the production server
[ ] SSL certificate installed and valid
[ ] Firewall configured (only 80/443 public)
[ ] Process manager running (PM2, systemd)
[ ] Rollback plan exists
[ ] Staging test passed before production deploy

CODE
[ ] No console.logs in production build
[ ] Error handling on all async operations
[ ] Loading and error states in UI
[ ] Pagination on all list endpoints
[ ] npm audit run, critical issues resolved

Can't check every box? You're not ready to ship.

The post-launch patch costs 10x more than the pre-launch fix.
