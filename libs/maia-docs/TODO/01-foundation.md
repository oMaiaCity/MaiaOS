# Foundation - Vision, Mission, Values

## Vision

Building 10x better environments for humans to thrive, in service of improving wealth, health and happiness for 8.1 billion humans every day.

## Mission

Building Maia City, Earth's first capital, where 1.3 million humans unite to create the foundational blueprint of a new breed of sovereign cities.

## Core Values

### Purpose-Driven
We believe every human action, product, and organization should serve a meaningful purpose beyond profit. Purpose-driven thinking guides our decisions, products, and community engagement, ensuring alignment with human flourishing.

### Self-Sovereignty
We champion individual autonomy and independence. Self-sovereignty means empowering each person with the tools, knowledge, and freedom to determine their own path, make their own decisions, and control their own destiny without unnecessary external dependencies.

### First-Principles
We approach problems by breaking them down to their fundamental truths and reasoning up from there. This methodology allows us to question assumptions, avoid conventional limitations, and build innovative solutions that address root causes rather than symptoms.

## Design Philosophy

Our approach combines:
- **Human-Centric Design**: Every system, platform, and product is designed with human needs, psychology, and wellbeing at the center
- **AI-Native Architecture**: Leveraging artificial intelligence not as an add-on, but as a foundational layer integrated into every aspect of our infrastructure
- **Distributed Governance**: Democratic principles guiding organizational structure and decision-making processes
- **Sustainable Economics**: Building wealth models that benefit communities while preserving individual sovereignty
- **Transparent Operations**: Open communication about goals, challenges, and progress

## Impact Goals

1. **Wealth**: Enable 1.3 million individuals to achieve financial self-sovereignty as Maia Creators
2. **Health**: Create environments that promote physical, mental, and social wellbeing
3. **Happiness**: Foster communities where purpose, autonomy, and connection drive daily life

## The 1.3 Million Thesis

Maia City targets 1.3 million citizens as the foundational population. This number represents:
- Sufficient scale to create a self-sustaining economy
- Manageable size for maintaining community cohesion
- Critical mass for demonstrating the viability of sovereign city models
- A blueprint that can be replicated globally

By proving the model with 1.3 million citizens, we establish the template for Earth's transition to a network of sovereign, purpose-driven cities.
