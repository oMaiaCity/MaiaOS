# Self-Improving Learning-Cycles Metrics
## How Maia City Measures What Actually Matters

*Written simply, for everyone to understand*

---

## The Big Question

**How do we know if Maia City is actually working?**

Think about SpaceX. They have one super clear goal: make each rocket launch cheaper than the last one. Every single thing they do gets measured against this one question: "Did this make rockets cheaper?"

Maia City needs the same clarity. We need one crystal-clear way to know if we're actually helping people or just making noise.

## The Answer: Time Sovereignty

### What's a Time Sovereign?

Imagine having full sovereignty over your 24 hours. Every minute is yours to allocate toward what YOU believe matters. Not obligations you didn't choose, not survival mode—but conscious choice about where your attention flows.

A **Time Sovereign** is someone who owns their time and uses it to create, research, innovate, build, serve, and explore. It's about waking up and asking "What do I want to create today?" and having the freedom to do exactly that.

## The Two Metrics That Rule Everything

### 1️⃣ INDIVIDUAL METRIC: Your Time Sovereignty

**The Question:** How sovereign are you over your time allocation?

**How We Measure It:**
- Out of 24 hours today, how many hours did you CHOOSE where to direct your attention?
- Did you spend time on creativity, research, building, serving—things aligned with your purpose?
- Are you consciously designing your days, or are external pressures designing them for you?

**The Goal:** Every Maia Citizen becomes a Time Sovereign—someone who has 100% agency over how they allocate their attention and energy.

**How We Calculate It:**

Each day, you track:
- **Sovereign Hours:** Time you CHOSE to allocate (research, creation, rest, service—YOUR choice)
- **External Pressure Hours:** Time spent due to survival needs, obligations you didn't choose

**Daily Sovereignty Score = (Sovereign Hours ÷ 24) × 100**

**Example Day 1 (Low Sovereignty):**
- 8 hours: Job you don't love (external pressure)
- 2 hours: Commute (external pressure)
- 2 hours: Household obligations (external pressure)
- 8 hours: Sleep (chosen)
- 4 hours: Your passion project (chosen)

**Score: (12 chosen hours ÷ 24) × 100 = 50% sovereignty**

**Example Day 2 (High Sovereignty):**
- 8 hours: Research you chose to do (chosen)
- 3 hours: Building a project you care about (chosen)
- 8 hours: Sleep (chosen)
- 2 hours: Serving a community you love (chosen)
- 3 hours: Rest and reflection (chosen)

**Score: (24 chosen hours ÷ 24) × 100 = 100% sovereignty**

**Monthly & Yearly Calculation with Weighted Dilution:**

Recent months matter MORE than old months. We use exponential weighting:

```
Monthly Score = Average of all daily scores in that month

Yearly Sovereignty Score = 
  (Month 1 × 0.5) + 
  (Month 2 × 0.6) + 
  (Month 3 × 0.7) + 
  (Month 4 × 0.8) + 
  (Month 5 × 0.9) + 
  (Month 6-12 × 1.0 each)
  ÷ Total Weight
```

**Simple Example Over 12 Months:**

| Month | Daily Avg | Weight | Weighted Score |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Jan (1) | 45% | 0.5 | 22.5 |
| Feb (2) | 50% | 0.6 | 30.0 |
| Mar (3) | 55% | 0.7 | 38.5 |
| Apr (4) | 60% | 0.8 | 48.0 |
| May (5) | 65% | 0.9 | 58.5 |
| Jun (6) | 70% | 1.0 | 70.0 |
| Jul (7) | 72% | 1.0 | 72.0 |
| Aug (8) | 75% | 1.0 | 75.0 |
| Sep (9) | 78% | 1.0 | 78.0 |
| Oct (10) | 80% | 1.0 | 80.0 |
| Nov (11) | 82% | 1.0 | 82.0 |
| Dec (12) | 85% | 1.0 | 85.0 |

**Total Weight:** 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.7 + 0.8 + 0.9 + (7 × 1.0) = 10.5

**Yearly Sovereignty Score:** 739.5 ÷ 10.5 = **70.4%**

**Why This Works:**
- Old struggles (January at 45%) get less weight (0.5) in your overall score
- Recent improvements (December at 85%) get full weight (1.0)
- You see continuous progress, not just averages
- The metric reflects your CURRENT sovereignty level, not your past

### 2️⃣ COLLECTIVE METRIC: Execution Speed to Sovereignty

**The Question:** How fast are we achieving collective time sovereignty?

**How We Measure It:**
- Right now, 1.3 million future Maia Citizens exist (anyone who invests 987€)
- How long would it take, at our current acceleration rate, for ALL of them to become Time Sovereigns?

**The Timeline:**
- **Day 1:** Maybe a billion years (we're just starting!)
- **Year 5:** Maybe down to 1 million years (we're accelerating!)
- **Year 2042:** Our moonshot goal—just 1 minute. Almost everyone is a Time Sovereign.

**Why This Matters:** This number tells us if we're accelerating or plateauing. It's our speedometer for collective liberation and creative capacity.

---

## Why These Metrics Are Perfect

### Every Decision Gets Simple

When someone creates a new Maia Vibe (an app or tool), we ask:
> "Does this increase people's sovereignty over their time and attention?"

When a Maia Agent does something, we ask:
> "Did this unlock more creative capacity, research potential, or ability to serve?"

When citizens start a project together, we ask:
> "Will this accelerate our collective journey to time sovereignty for all?"

If the answer is YES → Do it.  
If the answer is NO → Don't do it.  
If we're not sure → Figure it out, then decide.

---

### It Connects to Everything Else

Think of it like building a house:

1. **Foundation (First):** Time Sovereignty
   - Creative work, deep research, meaningful innovation—these all require space to think and create
   - Yes, survival needs must be met, but that's just the ground we build on
   - Time sovereignty means you have the capacity to direct your attention toward what you believe matters most

2. **Walls & Roof (Next):** Creative & Service Capacity
   - Once people have sovereignty over their time, they allocate it toward their passions and purpose
   - They start creating breakthrough research, art, tools, communities, and innovations
   - They serve causes they believe in, mentor others, and build what matters to them

3. **The Neighborhood (Eventually):** Thriving Environments for All Humanity
   - As more people become Time Sovereigns, they create systems that unlock even MORE sovereignty
   - These systems—tools, vibes, research, innovations—help others gain sovereignty faster
   - The cycle accelerates exponentially—this is the "self-improving" part!

You can't skip steps. You can't build creative capacity without first establishing sovereignty. Time sovereignty is THE foundation that everything else rests on—the breeding ground where thriving environments naturally emerge.

---

## The Self-Improving Loop

Here's where it gets exciting. This metric creates a loop that makes itself faster:

```
1. A Maia Citizen gains 1 hour of sovereign time
   ↓
2. They use that hour to research, create, or build a Vibe that helps others
   ↓
3. That Vibe unlocks 1 hour of sovereignty for 10 other citizens
   ↓
4. Those 10 citizens now have 10 sovereign hours total to allocate
   ↓
5. They invest those hours in innovation, creativity, service, and building more tools
   ↓
6. The cycle accelerates exponentially
```

**This is the magic:** The more people who become Time Sovereigns, the faster EVERYONE becomes Time Sovereigns. Each sovereign creator multiplies creative capacity across the whole network.

---

## How AI Agents Learn & Get Better

Every Maia Agent (AI helper) gets trained on this simple rule:

> "Your job is to increase time sovereignty and unlock creative capacity for Maia Citizens."

**Example:**
- An agent suggests a research tool that opens new creative possibilities → EXCELLENT (unlocks new capacity)
- An agent automates repetitive tasks so citizens can focus on creation → VERY GOOD (redistributes attention)
- An agent creates complexity without unlocking capacity → BAD (validated against the metric)
- An agent connects a citizen with a collaborator that accelerates their work → EXCELLENT (multiplies capacity)

The agents get feedback constantly:
- Did the citizen gain sovereignty? ✅
- Did their creative/research/service capacity increase? ✅
- Did they choose this allocation? ✅

Over time, agents learn what actually unlocks capacity and what doesn't. They get better at helping people become Time Sovereigns who create, innovate, and serve at their highest potential.

---

## The Simple Version (If You Only Remember One Thing)

**Maia City exists to turn people into Time Sovereigns—creators with full agency over their attention, capacity, and purpose.**

Every single thing we build, every decision we make, every AI agent we train, every project we start—all of it asks one question:

> "Does this unlock sovereignty and creative capacity?"

If yes → we do it.  
If no → we don't.  
If we don't know → we figure it out first.

That's it. That's the whole strategy.

---

## Why This Is Different

Most cities, companies, and projects measure the wrong things:
- "Users" (but are they creating?)
- "Revenue" (but are people sovereign?)
- "Engagement" (but is it unlocking capacity?)

Maia City measures what actually matters:
- **Are people becoming Time Sovereigns with full creative capacity?**
- **How fast are we accelerating collective sovereignty?**

The first question is about INDIVIDUAL sovereignty and creative capacity.  
The second question is about COLLECTIVE acceleration and network effects.  
Together, they create a complete picture.

---

## The Promise

By 2042, if you're a Maia Citizen, you'll be able to say:

"I am a Time Sovereign. I have full agency over my attention and creative energy. I spend my days researching what fascinates me, building innovations that matter, serving causes I believe in, and creating art that expresses my truth. My life is aligned with my purpose."

And the best part? You'll be surrounded by 1.3 million other Time Sovereigns, all creating breakthrough innovations, conducting meaningful research, and building thriving environments together.

That's the promised land.  
That's Maia City.  
That's what we're measuring.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if someone doesn't want to be a Time Sovereign?**  
A: That's okay! This metric is for people who DO want sovereignty to create, research, and innovate. If someone prefers a traditional path and that fulfills them, wonderful. Maia City is for people who want agency over how they allocate their creative energy.

**Q: How do you measure "time sovereignty" exactly?**  
A: We'll build tools that help citizens track their choice allocation. Think of it like a compass for attention. Simple questions: "Did you choose to allocate time here? Is this aligned with your purpose? Did this increase your creative capacity?"

**Q: Won't this take forever?**  
A: That's why we track the execution speed metric. We're designing for exponential acceleration. Each Time Sovereign creates tools and innovations that unlock sovereignty for many others. The loop multiplies itself.

**Q: What if AI agents optimize for the metric in bad ways?**  
A: Great question! We validate constantly with real citizens. The metric isn't just "free time"—it's "sovereign, chosen allocation toward creative capacity." Quality matters, not just quantity. Idle time without purpose doesn't count. It's about unlocking the capacity to create, research, innovate, and serve.

**Q: Is 2042 realistic?**  
A: It's ambitious, not easy. But SpaceX said they'd land rockets vertically and everyone laughed. We're serious about this timeline. Even if we don't hit exactly 2042, we'll be way ahead of where we'd be without a clear target.
