# Sparks: When Humans Become Creators

## Act 1: You Discover Your Creative Power

Something remarkable happens when AI agents handle execution. When coordination becomes nearly free. When cognitive work scales infinitely.

**Humans stop being workers and become creators.**

Throughout history, most people spent their time executing tasks. Implementing plans made by others. Maintaining systems designed before they arrived. Their creativity got confined to narrow spaces because someone had to do the work. Someone had to operate the machines, file the paperwork, coordinate logistics. Human bandwidth got consumed by execution.

Sparks flip this. A Spark is a cooperative where humans direct and AI agents execute. You define the vision—what should exist, what values guide it, what outcomes matter. Then a fleet of specialized AI agents handles everything else: planning, operations, coordination, optimization, reporting. The cooperative operates itself. Your role isn't maintaining machinery—it's directing vision.

### What a Spark looks like

When you create WaterSpark, you're not building it the old way. You're not hiring engineers, managing technicians, coordinating teams, handling endless operational details. You write a specification articulating purpose: water as commons, regenerative management, watershed restoration. You invest Hearts. Others join if they believe in it.

Then you deploy your agent fleet. Planning agents design distribution systems. Engineering agents specify infrastructure. Operations agents manage purification and delivery. Financial agents track revenue. Environmental agents monitor ecosystem impacts. These agents coordinate with each other continuously, at machine speed, without requiring you to sit in meetings or write status reports.

Within weeks, WaterSpark is operational. Not because you worked 80-hour weeks, but because cognitive work is cheap when agents handle execution. Your job was judgment—reviewing proposals, making tradeoffs, refining direction. The agents did everything else.

### Your role as director

Morning: Your concierge agent summarizes overnight activity. Water quality readings, usage patterns, revenue streams. Three optimization proposals from engineering agents. One ecosystem concern flagged by environmental agents. You review in 15 minutes, approve two proposals, request more data on the third, escalate the concern to co-founders.

Afternoon: Citizens are using water. Payments stream to WaterSpark treasury. Revenue distributes automatically to all owners. You're earning from the system you created, but you don't touch it—it operates itself.

Evening: A governance proposal arrives. Another cooperative wants to partner on greywater recycling. Agents have already analyzed feasibility, financials, and environmental impact. Your job is judgment: Should we do this? You vote yes with co-founders. Agents begin implementing the partnership. Coordination happens automatically between agent fleets.

This is operating as a creator. You're not maintaining. You're directing.

## Act 2: You Build Stakes

### Joining existing cooperatives

Month 1, you invest 20,000 Hearts into SolarSpark (energy cooperative). You receive 10,000 SolarMinds—2% ownership of the entire energy system. The cooperative generates 25,000 in revenue monthly. Your 2% means you earn 500 per month automatically. Citizens consume electricity, you earn from your stake. No work required beyond the initial investment decision.

### Founding your cooperative

Month 3, you create WaterSpark. Invest 30,000 Hearts, receive 15,000 ownership units. Recruit Bob and Charlie. Total citizen holdings: 23,000 units. Your 15,000 means you own 65% as founder—the majority stake.

You deploy the agent fleet and operations begin. Citizens consume water, stream payments to the cooperative, revenue distributes to all owners. You're earning 65% of all revenue because you're the founder. Month 6, that's 6,500 per month from this one cooperative alone.

### Building portfolio

By Month 6, you own stakes in: City infrastructure (25,000 units, 0.1%), Energy (10,000 units, 2%), Food (5,000 units, 1.5%), Transit (3,000 units, 1%), Water (15,000 units, 65% founder). Five different cooperatives, five revenue streams, 7,505 per month combined earnings.

Your spending: 450 per month total. Your earnings: 7,505. Net: +7,055 per month. You're earning 16x what you spend because ownership scales while consumption doesn't.

## Act 3: You Become a Founder

### The selection

Month 24, simulation reaches 1.3 million citizens. Top 100 cooperatives identified by performance. Your WaterSpark ranks #23. Top 987 contributors selected. You're one of them based on your founder track record.

Your cooperative incorporates as a real-world startup. You transition from virtual founder to actual company co-founder. Move to Mediterranean village with 987 others. Spend 2-3 years building real water technology for the physical city.

### What changed

You discovered you're a creator. Not a worker executing someone else's plan, but someone who can direct AI agent fleets to build operating systems serving thousands. The constraint wasn't your capability—it was that someone had to do all the work. When agents handle execution, your creative potential unlocks.

Before MaiaCity: Employee working for wages, owning nothing, executing tasks, trapped in someone else's system.

After MaiaCity: Director of cooperatives, owner of stakes earning continuous revenue, creator founding new systems, operating at the level of vision and judgment while agents handle everything else.

---

**Summary:** Sparks are cooperatives where you direct and AI agents execute. You deploy agent fleets to handle operations while you focus on vision and judgment. Founding a Spark means becoming a creator, not a maintainer. The top 100 Sparks become real companies in Phase 2, and founders transition to real-world. Your transformation: Worker → Director → Founder → Creator.
