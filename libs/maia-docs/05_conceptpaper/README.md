# MaiaCity Concept Paper

## Overview

This concept paper explains how MaiaCity works—a simulation game that becomes a real city where 1.3 million citizens build Earth's new capital together.

## Structure

### **01_vision.md** - Start Here
**Why are we doing this?**

The philosophical foundation explaining:
- Unlocking 95% of human potential
- Becoming a Time Owner (owning all 24 hours of your day)
- Building 10x better environments for 8 billion humans
- The three-phase roadmap

**Read this first** to understand the "why" before diving into the "how."

---

### **02_phase1/** - The Simulation
**How does the virtual simulation work?**

Where 1.3 million virtual citizens learn, build, and prove the model works before physical construction.

**Documents (read in order):**
1. `01_intro.md` - Why simulate? What does it prove?
2. `02_your_journey.md` - Your simple story (start here if you know nothing)
3. `03_hearts.md` - Investment mechanics
4. `04_minds.md` - Ownership stakes
5. `05_sparks.md` - Becoming a creator directing AI agents
6. `06_property.md` - Two-layer property market

**Complexity:** Builds from why → simple story → mechanics → advanced concepts

---

### **03_phase2/** - Maia Valley
**How do top Sparks become real companies?**

*Coming soon:* Top 100 Sparks incorporate as startups, top 1,000 contributors become co-founders, move to Mediterranean village.

---

### **04_phase3/** - Real MaiaCity
**How do we build the physical city?**

*Coming soon:* 1.3M citizens transition from virtual to physical, deploy proven model, build Earth's new capital.

## Reading Recommendations

### If you want the BIG PICTURE:
1. Read `01_vision.md`
2. Skim `02_phase1/01_simulation.md`

### If you want to UNDERSTAND DEEPLY:
1. Read `01_vision.md` (the why)
2. Read all of `02_phase1/` in order (the how)
3. Check back for Phase 2 & 3 documentation

### If you want to PARTICIPATE:
1. Read all documents
2. Join the simulation when available
3. Start building your ownership stakes

## Key Concepts

**Hearts:** Your investment power (125,000 to start, can only invest, not sell)

**SparkMinds:** Your ownership stakes (earn continuous revenue from cooperatives)

**Sparks:** AI-powered cooperatives you can co-own

**Time Owner:** Someone who owns all 24 hours of their day

**Three Phases:**
1. Simulation (virtual, 1.3M citizens)
2. Valley (top 100 Sparks → real startups)
3. City (physical reality, 2042 target)

## Contributing

This is a living document. As the project evolves, documentation will be updated and expanded.
