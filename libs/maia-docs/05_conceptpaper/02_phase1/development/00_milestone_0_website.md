# Milestone 0: Landing Page Copy

## Vision
A single-page, minimal-scroll landing page that hooks curiosity immediately. No long paragraphs. Bold statements. Clear progression from vision → simulation → reality. One powerful message per section.

---

## Landing Page Structure

### Hero Section (Above Fold)

**Headline:**
```
Own the future.
Build it together.
```

**Subheadline:**
```
A simulation game where 1.3 million citizens 
co-create Earth's new capital.
```

**CTA Button:**
```
Join Waitlist
```

**Visual:** Minimal. Abstract city silhouette or animated gradient. Nothing distracting.

---

### The Hook (First Scroll)

**Section Title:**
```
What if you owned everything?
```

**Body:**
```
Not just your apartment. Not just your job.

Everything.

The land beneath your feet. The energy powering your home. 
The food you eat. The transit you use.

You own it all. Together with 1.3 million others.

And it's not a dream. It's a simulation game—starting now.
```

---

### The Vision (Second Scroll)

**Section Title:**
```
From Simulation to Reality
```

**Three Columns:**

**Phase 1: The Simulation**
```
1.3M citizens play
Prove the model works
Build ownership stakes
Earn from cooperatives
```

**Phase 2: Maia Valley**
```
Top 100 Sparks become real startups
1,000 founders co-live and build
Restore a Mediterranean village
Launch real-world companies
```

**Phase 3: The City**
```
Buy land together
Build Earth's new capital
1.3M citizens move in
Ownership model scales globally
```

---

### The Promise (Third Scroll)

**Section Title:**
```
Become a Time Owner
```

**Body:**
```
Most people spend their lives making others wealthy.

In MaiaCity, you own the cooperatives you consume from.

Your rent? You earn it back through ownership.
Your electricity bill? You profit from it.
Your food costs? Revenue flows to you.

You're not a renter. You're an owner.

You're not an employee. You're a founder.

You're not trapped. You're free.

Own your time. Own your wealth. Own your future.
```

---

### The Invitation (Final Scroll)

**Section Title:**
```
Join the Waitlist
```

**Body:**
```
Reserve your spot. Reserve your identity.

1€ secures your place in the simulation.

When we launch, you'll be among the first to:
• Own part of the city from day one
• Found cooperatives with AI agents
• Build wealth through ownership
• Potentially become a Valley co-founder

```

**CTA Button:**

## Copy Principles

**Do:**
- ✅ Bold, declarative statements
- ✅ Short sentences. One idea per line.
- ✅ Active voice ("You own" not "Ownership is possible")
- ✅ Concrete benefits ("Own your time" not "Time freedom")
- ✅ Clear progression (Simulation → Valley → City)
- ✅ Urgency without pressure

**Don't:**
- ❌ Long paragraphs
- ❌ Jargon or buzzwords
- ❌ Vague promises
- ❌ Multiple CTAs competing
- ❌ Overwhelming information

---

## Visual Hierarchy

**Above Fold:**
1. Headline (largest, boldest)
2. Subheadline (medium, readable)
3. CTA button (prominent, glassmorphic)
4. Visual (subtle, doesn't compete)

**Below Fold (if scrolling):**
- Each section: Title → Body → (optional visual)
- Maximum 3-4 sections total
- Each section = one screen height max
- Clear visual breaks between sections

---

## Tone

**Confident, not arrogant**
- "Own the future" not "We're building the future"

**Inclusive, not exclusive**
- "Together with 1.3 million others" not "Join the elite"

**Clear, not complex**
- "You own it" not "Decentralized ownership model"

**Inspiring, not preachy**
- "Own your time" not "Escape the rat race"

---

## Success Metrics

**Does it hook?**
- User reads headline → Wants to know more
- User sees "1.3 million citizens" → Curious how that works
- User sees "Own everything" → Intrigued, maybe skeptical (good!)

**Does it clarify?**
- User understands: Simulation → Valley → City
- User understands: Ownership model, not traditional city
- User understands: Invite-only, 1€ reservation

**Does it convert?**
- User clicks "Join Waitlist" → Enters signup flow
- User pays 1€ → Commits to being part of it

---

## Variations to Test

**Version A: Benefit-Focused**
```
Own your time. Own your wealth. Own your future.
```

**Version B: Problem-Focused**
```
Tired of making others wealthy?
Build wealth together instead.
```

**Version C: Vision-Focused**
```
1.3 million citizens. One city. Everything owned together.
```

**Version D: Action-Focused**
```
Join the simulation. Prove the model. Build the city.
```

---

**Outcome:** A landing page that sparks curiosity, clarifies the vision, and converts visitors into waitlist members. Minimal scrolling, maximum impact.
