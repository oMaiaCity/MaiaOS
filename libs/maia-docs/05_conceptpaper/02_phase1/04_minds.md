# Minds: Your Ownership Stakes

## Act 1: From Hearts to Stakes

When you invest 100 Hearts into a cooperative, they transform into what we call SparkMinds. You receive 50 SparkMinds representing your ownership, the cooperative treasury receives 50 for operations. These SparkMinds serve three purposes simultaneously: they're your ownership stake earning revenue, they're currency you spend consuming services, and they're tradeable assets you can exchange in markets.

After your mandatory city investment, you hold 25,000 MaiaMinds representing 0.1% ownership of all city infrastructure. When you invest 20,000 Hearts into the energy cooperative, you receive 10,000 SolarMinds representing 2% ownership. Each type of SparkMind connects to a specific cooperative, and each generates revenue based on that cooperative's performance.

## Act 2: Ownership Generates Revenue

### The earning pattern

Your 10,000 SolarMinds mean you own 2% of the energy cooperative. Every time someone consumes electricity, they stream payment to the cooperative. The cooperative distributes this revenue to all SolarMind holders proportionally. You receive 2% of all revenue, continuously, every second the cooperative operates.

Example: The energy cooperative generates 25,000 SolarMinds per month in revenue. Your 2% means you earn 500 SolarMinds monthly. This happens automatically without you doing anything—just from holding the ownership stake.

### Multiple stakes compound

Month 6, you hold stakes in five cooperatives. Each one generates revenue. MaiaSpark gives you 80 per month from land leases and infrastructure fees. Energy gives 500. Food gives 225. Transit gives 200. Water (where you're a 65% founder) gives 6,500. Combined: 7,505 per month flowing to you continuously from five different sources.

Your spending: 430 per month across rent, electricity, food, and transit. Your net: +7,075 per month. You're earning 16x more than you spend because you own pieces of everything you consume.

### The circular insight

When you spend SparkMinds consuming services, you're partially paying yourself. You consume electricity and stream 30 SolarMinds to the energy cooperative. The cooperative distributes revenue to all owners. You receive 2% back—about 0.6 SolarMinds. Your net cost is 29.4 instead of 30.

This happens across everything you consume. Rent flows to housing cooperative, you earn back your ownership share. Food flows to food cooperative, same pattern. The more you own, the more your spending circulates back to you.

## Act 3: You Master Portfolio Value

### Strategic optimization

Month 12, you understand which cooperatives generate strong returns. Energy performs well at 10% annual revenue. Water (your founding) performs even better at 12%. Transit struggles at 3%. You trade some Transit stakes for more Energy stakes, shifting your portfolio toward winners.

This is possible because SparkMinds, unlike Hearts, are tradeable. You can rebalance based on performance. Exit underperformers, accumulate high-performers. The market prices each cooperative's SparkMinds based on revenue potential, and you optimize accordingly.

### Wealth compounds

Month 1, you earned about 1,000 per month from ownership stakes. Month 6, you earned 7,525. Month 12, you're earning over 15,000 as your cooperatives grow and you reinvest earnings into more stakes. The compounding happens because ownership generates revenue that you can reinvest into more ownership.

By Month 24, you're a proven stakeholder selected for Phase 2. Your portfolio of ownership stakes will continue generating revenue even as you transition to building real companies in the Valley.

---

**Summary:** SparkMinds are ownership stakes that earn continuous revenue. The 50/50 split creates alignment between you and the cooperative. Multiple stakes across cooperatives diversify your income. Your spending partially circulates back through ownership. Wealth grows through compounding ownership stakes, not wages from work.
