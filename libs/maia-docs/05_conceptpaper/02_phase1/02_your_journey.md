# Your Journey: The Simulation

## Act 1: You Start

You join MaiaCity and receive **125,000 Hearts**—your investment power. Hearts are special money you can only invest, not sell or trade to others. Think of them as tickets to become a co-owner of cooperatives.

The simulation requires your first investment immediately: Put 50,000 Hearts (40%) into the city itself. This transforms into 25,000 ownership units for you, and 25,000 for the city treasury to operate. You now own a tiny slice of everything—the land, the underground infrastructure, all of it. When the city earns money, you earn your proportional share.

You have 75,000 Hearts left to invest however you want.

## Act 2: You Learn by Doing

### Week 1: You discover cooperatives

The city has cooperatives run by AI agents. Energy cooperative provides electricity. Food cooperative grows food. Housing cooperative builds apartments. These aren't owned by corporations—they're owned by citizens like you who invested Hearts to get ownership stakes.

You invest 10,000 Hearts into the energy cooperative. You receive 5,000 ownership units, the cooperative gets 5,000 for operations. Now when anyone uses electricity across the city, payments flow to the cooperative and get distributed to all owners. You're earning continuously from your stake.

### Month 1: The pattern becomes clear

You invest Hearts into more cooperatives. Food, housing, transit. Each investment gives you ownership stakes. Each stake generates revenue as people consume services. Soon you're earning from five different sources simultaneously.

Here's what surprises you: You're earning more than you're spending. Your apartment costs 150 per month. Your electricity, food, and transit cost another 280. Total spending: 430 per month.

But you're earning from your ownership stakes: 100 from city infrastructure, 500 from energy, 225 from food, 150 from housing, 100 from transit. Total earnings: 1,075 per month.

You're net positive by 645 per month. You're earning 2.5x what you're spending because you own pieces of what you consume.

### Month 3: You create something

You notice the city needs better water management. Not just pipes, but regenerative systems that restore watersheds. You write a proposal for a water cooperative and invest 30,000 Hearts as founder. Others join—Bob with 10,000 Hearts, Charlie with 6,000. Together you've capitalized the cooperative with 46,000 Hearts.

You deploy AI agents to handle everything. Planning agents design the distribution network. Engineering agents optimize purification. Operations agents manage day-to-day execution. You review their work and exercise judgment, but you're not doing the technical implementation yourself. You're directing the vision while agents handle the details.

Within weeks, the water cooperative is operational. Citizens consume water, payments stream in, and as the 65% founder, you're earning the majority of revenue. You went from idea to operating business in weeks because AI agents handled the execution.

## Act 3: You Transform

### Month 12: You're a founder

Your water cooperative serves 50,000 citizens. It generates 10,000 in revenue monthly. Your 65% stake means you're earning 6,500 per month just from this one cooperative. Combined with your other stakes, you're earning 15x what you spend.

You've learned that you can create. Not just ideas—actual operating systems serving thousands of people. You discovered this not through theory but through doing it.

### Month 24: You're selected

The simulation reaches 1.3 million citizens. Performance data identifies the top 100 cooperatives. Your water cooperative ranks #23. You're selected as one of the top 1,000 contributors.

What happens next: Your cooperative incorporates as a real-world startup. You become a co-founder. You move to a village on the Mediterranean Sea with 987 other top contributors. You'll spend 2-3 years building actual water systems, restoring real watersheds, preparing technology for the physical city.

You went from virtual citizen to real-world founder in 24 months.

**What you learned:**
The pattern is simple: Invest Hearts → Get ownership stakes → Earn from cooperatives → Reinvest → Grow wealth. The transformation is profound: Consumer → Owner → Founder → Creator.
