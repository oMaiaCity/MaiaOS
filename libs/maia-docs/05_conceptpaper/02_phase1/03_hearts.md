# Hearts: Your Investment Power

## Act 1: You Receive Your Stake

You start with **125,000 Hearts**—your personal investment power. They're named after you (AliceHearts, BobHearts) and you can't sell or trade them to others. This ensures everyone keeps their economic stake in the city.

Hearts have two characteristics worth knowing: They replenish daily at +24 Hearts, and they have a 7% annual flow rate that encourages investment over hoarding. At 125,000 Hearts, these balance out perfectly—the replenishment roughly offsets the flow, creating an equilibrium.

What matters most is this: Hearts exist to become ownership stakes in cooperatives.

## Act 2: You Build Ownership

### The mandatory investment

You must put 62,500 Hearts (half) into MaiaSpark—the city itself. This transforms into 31,250 ownership units for you and 31,250 for the city treasury. You now co-own all the land surface and everything underground: water pipes, electricity grids, autonomous transit systems, logistics networks, storage facilities.

This mandatory investment means everyone's a city co-owner from day one. When any cooperative leases land or uses infrastructure, payments flow to MaiaSpark and distribute to all owners. You earn from the entire city operating.

### Your strategic choice

Your remaining 75,000 Hearts are yours. Most citizens invest quickly across multiple cooperatives because ownership generates revenue streams. Holding Hearts means missing out on earnings.

You might invest 20,000 Hearts into energy (receive 10,000 ownership units), 15,000 into food (7,500 units), 10,000 into transit (5,000 units). Each stake means you earn proportionally when people consume those services. The more you own, the more revenue streams you build.

### Founding your own

Month 3, you create a water cooperative. Invest 30,000 Hearts as founder, receive 15,000 ownership units. Recruit Bob (10,000 Hearts) and Charlie (6,000 Hearts). Together you've created a cooperative with 23,000 citizen-held units.

Your 15,000 units mean you own 65% as founder. When the cooperative generates revenue, you earn the majority. You're not just an investor anymore—you're a founder building something new.

## Act 3: You Become a Stakeholder

### Your portfolio reality

Six months in, you own stakes across five cooperatives. MaiaSpark gives you 80 per month. Energy gives you 500. Food gives 225. Transit gives 200. Water (your founding) gives 6,500. Total: 7,505 per month in continuous revenue streams.

Your costs: 450 per month for rent, electricity, food, transit, water combined.

You're earning 16x more than you're spending. Not because you worked harder, but because you own pieces of what you consume. The ownership stakes you built from your 125,000 Hearts are generating wealth continuously.

### The transformation

Before, you worked for wages and owned nothing. After, you direct cooperatives and own everything you use. Your Hearts became ownership stakes. Those stakes generate revenue. That revenue exceeds your costs. You're building wealth through participation, not exploitation.

The pattern was simple: Transform Hearts into ownership → Ownership generates revenue → Revenue builds more ownership. By Month 24, you're a proven founder selected for Phase 2, moving from virtual to real-world.

---

**Summary:** Hearts are investment power that becomes ownership. The 7% flow rate encourages investing over holding. The 50/50 split means you and the cooperative both benefit. Multiple stakes create multiple income streams. Ownership transforms you from consumer to co-creator of wealth.
