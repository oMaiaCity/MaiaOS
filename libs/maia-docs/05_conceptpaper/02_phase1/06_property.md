# Property: Your Two-Layer Wealth System

## Act 1: You Discover the Split

Property in MaiaCity works differently than anywhere else. It's split into two layers: underground and above-ground.

**Underground (Layer 1):** MaiaSpark owns everything below the surface—all the land, plus water pipes, electricity grids, autonomous transit tunnels, logistics networks, storage facilities. Every building connects to this infrastructure. Every connection generates revenue flowing to MaiaSpark, distributed to all MaiaMind holders (including you).

**Above-ground (Layer 2):** Sparks (cooperatives) lease land surface from MaiaSpark, then build structures on top. Housing cooperative builds apartments. Office cooperative builds workspaces. These buildings are owned by the Sparks, not the city. The Sparks then rent those buildings to citizens in open markets.

You're a stakeholder in both layers. Your mandatory MaiaMind investment means you co-own all land and underground infrastructure. Your optional investments in housing or office cooperatives mean you co-own specific buildings.

## Act 2: You Earn From Both Layers

### Layer 1: Land and infrastructure

HousingSpark wants to build apartments downtown. They bid 10,000 MaiaMinds per month for surface rights to a land parcel through continuous auction. Other cooperatives can outbid anytime, so land flows to highest-value use. HousingSpark wins and starts construction.

Once built, the building connects to MaiaSpark's underground infrastructure—water pipes, electricity cables, transit station. HousingSpark pays usage fees for these connections on top of the land lease. All of this revenue flows to MaiaSpark treasury and distributes to you and all other MaiaMind holders proportionally.

Your monthly earnings from Layer 1: About 50 MaiaMinds from all the land leases and infrastructure fees across the entire city. You're earning from every cooperative that uses land or connects to infrastructure.

### Layer 2: Buildings and rentals

HousingSpark built 50 apartments. They set market prices: studios at 80, one-bedrooms at 150, two-bedrooms at 280 per month in HousingMinds. Citizens choose apartments based on price and quality. You choose a one-bedroom for 150 HousingMinds per month.

Your payment streams continuously to HousingSpark. They collect revenue from all 50 apartments (about 7,500 total per month), pay their land lease and infrastructure fees to MaiaSpark, cover maintenance, and distribute remaining revenue to HousingMind holders.

If you invested 10,000 Hearts in HousingSpark earlier, you hold 5,000 HousingMinds representing 2% ownership. Your earnings: 150 per month (2% of 7,500 revenue). Your cost: 150 per month (your rent). You break even on housing while living there!

### Your dual position

As MaiaMind holder: You earn from HousingSpark's land lease (10,000 per month flowing to MaiaSpark, you get your 0.1% share).

As HousingMind holder: You earn from HousingSpark's rental revenue (7,500 per month, you get your 2% share).

You're benefiting from both the land value (Layer 1) and the building operations (Layer 2). Your rent payment circulates through both layers and partially flows back to you through your ownership stakes.

## Act 3: You Optimize Position

### Strategic choices

Month 6, you realize you can optimize. You're paying 150 for housing but earning 150 back from your HousingMind stake—essentially living rent-free. Plus you're earning about 1 MaiaMind per month from HousingSpark's land lease payment to the city.

You invest more Hearts into housing cooperatives. Now you're earning more from housing than you spend, turning it into a profit center instead of a cost. This pattern applies across everything—energy, food, transit. The more you own, the more your costs become income.

### Competition benefits you

Multiple housing cooperatives compete for residents. HousingSpark charges 150 per month. CozyHomeSpark charges 130 for similar apartments. Competition drives prices down, quality up. As a resident, you benefit from lower prices. As a MaiaMind holder, you benefit from both cooperatives leasing land and using infrastructure.

When cooperatives compete efficiently, everyone wins. Residents get better value. Cooperative owners earn from genuine value creation. Land value (Layer 1) increases as more cooperatives want prime locations, benefiting all city co-owners.

### What changed

Before MaiaCity, landlords owned land and buildings. You paid full rent—pure extraction. No ownership, no control, value concentrated with owners.

After MaiaCity, you co-own the land and infrastructure through MaiaSpark (Layer 1), and you can co-own the buildings through housing cooperatives (Layer 2). Your rent payments flow through both layers and partially return to you through ownership stakes. You transformed from pure renter into dual stakeholder earning from both the land beneath and the building above.

---

**Summary:** Property splits into underground (MaiaSpark owns) and above-ground (Sparks own). MaiaSpark leases land to Sparks via auctions. Sparks build and rent buildings to citizens via open markets. You earn from Layer 1 (land and infrastructure) through mandatory MaiaMind holdings. You earn from Layer 2 (buildings) by investing in housing cooperatives. The two-layer system means you're a stakeholder in both the land value and the building operations.
