  <h1>Social Media Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h3>Our social media appearances</h3>
  <h4>This privacy policy applies to the following social media presence</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a
        href="https://instagram.com/HominioMe"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://instagram.com/HominioMe</a

  </ul>
  <h4>Data processing through social networks</h4>
  <p>
    We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual
    social networks we use can be found below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Social networks such as Facebook, X etc. can generally analyze your user
    behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with
    integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you
    visit our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing
    operations are triggered. In detail:
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media
    page, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your
    user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also be
    recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the
    respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for
    example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media
    portals can create user profiles in which their preferences and interests
    are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and
    outside of your social media presence. If you have an account with the
    social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on any device
    you are logged in to or have logged in to.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the
    social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing
    operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media
    portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the
    respective social media portals.
  </p>
  <h4>Legal basis</h4>
  <p>
    Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on
    the Internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)
    lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be
    based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the
    social networks (e.g., consent within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
  </p>
  <h4>Responsibility and assertion of rights</h4>
  <p>
    If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together
    with the operator of the social media platform, are responsible for the data
    processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle
    protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of
    processing, data portability and complaint) vis-à-vis us as well as
    vis-à-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g.,
    Facebook).
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media
    portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing
    operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the
    company policy of the respective provider.
  </p>
  <h4>Storage time</h4>
  <p>
    The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be
    deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, you revoke your
    consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored
    cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory
    provisions - in particular, retention periods - remain unaffected.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by
    the social network operators for their own purposes. For details, please
    contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy
    policy, see below).
  </p>
  <h4>Your rights</h4>
  <p>
    You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and
    purpose of your stored personal data at any time and free of charge. You
    also have the right to object, the right to data portability and the right
    to file a complaint with the responsible regulatory agency. Furthermore, you
    can request the correction, blocking, deletion and, under certain
    circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
