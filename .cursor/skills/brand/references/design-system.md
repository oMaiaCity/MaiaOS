# Design System: Botanical Organic Serif

## 1. Design Philosophy

This style is a **digital ode to nature**—it breathes, flows, and grounds itself in organic beauty. It is **soft, sophisticated, and deeply intentional**, rejecting the rigid, hyper-digital sharpness of modern tech aesthetics in favor of **warmth, tactility, and natural imperfection**.

### Core Essence
The Botanical Organic style embodies the calming presence of a botanical garden, the earthy warmth of a ceramics studio, and the refined elegance of editorial design. It whispers rather than shouts. Every element feels **hand-touched, sun-warmed, and naturally crafted**.

### Fundamental Principles

*   **Vibe**: Peaceful, curated, artisanal, high-end wellness, sustainable luxury, botanical elegance
*   **Visual DNA**:
    *   **Organic Softness**: Hard angles are purposefully rare. Every corner is rounded, every shape flows like water-smoothed stones or unfurling leaves. The 200px arch radius on images creates iconic architectural moments.
    *   **Typographic Elegance**: Typography is the protagonist—Playfair Display's high-contrast strokes command attention while maintaining grace. Italics add a handwritten, personal touch. Headlines breathe with generous scale (text-5xl to text-8xl).
    *   **Earthbound Palette**: Every color derives from nature—forest floors, clay pottery, sage gardens, terracotta tiles. No artificial brights. Muted, sophisticated, grounded.
    *   **Tactile Texture**: The subtle paper grain overlay is non-negotiable—it transforms cold digital pixels into warm, touchable surfaces. This is the secret ingredient that prevents flatness.
    *   **Breathing Space**: Whitespace is sacred. Sections have generous vertical padding (py-32), cards float with ample gaps (gap-8, gap-16), and every element has room to exist without crowding.
    *   **Intentional Movement**: Animations are slow, graceful, and fluid—like plants swaying in breeze. Duration-500 to duration-700 with ease-out curves. Nothing snaps or jerks.
    *   **Staggered Rhythm**: Breaking the grid creates natural, organic flow. Every second feature card translates vertically. Images rotate subtly. The design breathes asymmetry within structure.

## 2. Design Token System

### Colors (Light Mode - Earthy & Muted)

*   **Background**: `#F9F8F4` (Warm Alabaster / Rice Paper) - Not stark white.
*   **Foreground**: `#2D3A31` (Deep Forest Green) - The primary text color. Softer than black.
*   **Primary/Accent**: `#8C9A84` (Sage Green) - For buttons, highlights, icons.
*   **Secondary/Muted**: `#DCCFC2` (Soft Clay / Mushroom) - For backgrounds of cards, secondary buttons.
*   **Border**: `#E6E2DA` (Stone) - Very subtle, low contrast.
*   **Interactive**: `#C27B66` (Terracotta) - Hover states or "call to action" pops.

### Typography

*   **Headings**: **"Playfair Display"** (Google Font). It is a transitional serif with high contrast strokes, feeling both classic and modern.
    *   Weight: 600/700 for headlines.
    *   Style: Italicize key words for emphasis.
*   **Body**: **"Source Sans 3"** (Google Font). A clean, legible humanist sans-serif that pairs beautifully with Playfair.
    *   Weight: 400/500.
*   **Scaling**: Large. Headlines should feel airy and grand.

### Radius & Shapes

*   **Radius**: Highly rounded.
    *   Standard Card: `rounded-3xl` (24px).
    *   Buttons: `rounded-full` (Pill shape).
    *   Images: Often `rounded-t-full` (Arch) or `rounded-[40px]`.
*   **Border**: Thin, delicate. `1px` solid.

### Shadows & Effects

*   **Elevation**: Very soft, diffused shadows. No harsh dark drops.
    *   Default: `0 4px 6px -1px rgba(45, 58, 49, 0.05)`
    *   Medium: `0 10px 15px -3px rgba(45, 58, 49, 0.05)`
    *   Large: `0 20px 40px -10px rgba(45, 58, 49, 0.05)`
    *   Extra Large: `0 25px 50px -12px rgba(45, 58, 49, 0.15)`
*   **Paper Grain Texture** (CRITICAL): A subtle SVG noise overlay is **mandatory** on the main background. This is applied as a fixed, full-screen overlay with `opacity-[0.015]` using an SVG fractal noise filter. This texture is the defining element that transforms the design from flat digital to warm, tactile, paper-like. Without it, the design loses its soul.
    ```jsx
    <div
      className="pointer-events-none fixed inset-0 z-50 opacity-[0.015]"
      style={{
        backgroundImage: `url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 400 400' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='noiseFilter'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.9' numOctaves='4' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23noiseFilter)'/%3E%3C/svg%3E")`,
        backgroundRepeat: "repeat",
      }}
    />
    ```
*   **Blur Effects**: Use backdrop-blur-sm on overlays (like the hero quote card) to create depth and layering.

## 3. Component Stylings

### Buttons

*   **Primary**: Pill-shaped (`rounded-full`). Background is **Deep Forest Green** (`#2D3A31`) with White text. On hover, it lightens slightly or shifts to Terracotta.
*   **Secondary**: Transparent background with a **Sage Green** border (`1px`). Text is Sage Green.
*   **Typography**: Uppercase, wide tracking (`tracking-widest`), small font size (text-sm).

### Cards (Features, Pricing)

*   **Background**: White (`#FFFFFF`) or Soft Clay (`#F2F0EB`).
*   **Border**: None or very subtle Stone (`#E6E2DA`).
*   **Shape**: `rounded-3xl`.
*   **Hover**: Slight lift (`-translate-y-1`) and a bloom of soft shadow.

### Inputs

*   **Style**: Underlined only (Border-bottom) or pill-shaped with a very light background (`#F2F0EB`).
*   **Focus**: No harsh blue rings. A soft Sage Green border transition.

## 4. Non-Generic "Bold" Choices

*   **Arch Imagery**: Use CSS `clip-path` or `border-radius` to turn standard rectangular images into **Arches** (classic Roman arch shape) or **Organic Blobs**.
*   **Overlapping Typography**: Allow big serif headlines to slightly overlap images or background shapes.
*   **Decorative Lines**: Use fine, 1px SVG lines that curve or meander to connect sections, mimicking vines or roots.
*   **Italic Emphasis**: Frequently use the *Italic* variant of Playfair Display for single words within a bold headline.

## 5. Layout Strategy & Spacing

*   **Container**: `max-w-7xl`. We want airiness.
*   **Whitespace**: Generous. `gap-12` or `gap-16` between grid items. `py-24` or `py-32` between sections.
*   **Grid**: Break the grid. Use `translate-y-12` on every second card in a row to create a "staggered" natural look.

## 6. Icons (Lucide React)

*   **Style**: Thin stroke (`stroke-width={1.5}`).
*   **Color**: Deep Forest Green or Sage.
*   **Integration**: Don't put them in heavy boxes. Let them float, or place them in soft, pale circles.

## 7. Animation & Micro-Interactions

*   **Feel**: Slow, graceful, fluid. Everything moves like it's suspended in honey or swaying in a gentle breeze. "Eased out" significantly.
*   **Durations**:
    *   Fast interactions: `duration-300` (button hovers, link colors)
    *   Standard: `duration-500` (card lifts, transforms)
    *   Slow, dramatic: `duration-700` to `duration-1000` (image scales, hero image hover)
*   **Hover Behaviors**:
    *   Cards: `-translate-y-1` or `-translate-y-2` with shadow intensification
    *   Images: `scale-105` with `duration-700` for smooth, luxurious feel
    *   Buttons: `bg-opacity-90` subtle darkening with `duration-300`
    *   Blog cards: Lift entire card while scaling image, arrow translates right (`translate-x-1`)
*   **Focus States**: Sage green ring (`ring-[#8C9A84]`) with 2px width and offset for accessibility
*   **Accordion**: Smooth height transitions with `max-h-0` to `max-h-48` and opacity fade
*   **Mobile Menu**: Slide in from top with backdrop
*   **Scroll**: Elements should gently fade up and float into place (`opacity-0` to `opacity-100`, `translate-y-4` to `translate-y-0`)

## 8. Responsive Strategy

*   **Mobile-First Approach**: The design gracefully adapts while maintaining its organic, sophisticated character.
*   **Navigation**: Desktop shows horizontal nav with Sign In button. Mobile displays hamburger menu that opens a full-screen overlay with vertical nav links.
*   **Hero Image**: Uses `aspect-[3/4]` on mobile, transitions to `aspect-square` with fixed height on md+ breakpoints. This prevents excessive height on small screens.
*   **Grid Breakpoints**:
    *   Features: `grid-cols-1` → `md:grid-cols-3`
    *   Stats: `grid-cols-2` → `md:grid-cols-4`
    *   Blog/Testimonials: `grid-cols-1` → `md:grid-cols-3`
    *   Pricing: `grid-cols-1` → `lg:grid-cols-3`
*   **Typography Scaling**: Headlines reduce from `text-8xl` to `text-5xl` on mobile. Body text remains `text-lg` but line-height adjusts.
*   **Spacing Adjustments**: `py-32` becomes `py-16` on mobile, `gap-16` becomes `gap-12`, padding reduces from `p-8` to `p-4` where needed.
*   **Touch Targets**: All buttons maintain minimum 44px height (`h-12`, `h-14`) for comfortable mobile tapping.
*   **Staggered Cards**: The `translate-y-12` offset on alternating cards only applies at `md:` breakpoint and above to prevent awkward stacking on mobile.
