# Hook Writing

## Core Principle

**Every hook must be about the reader's transformation.** The goal is to create attention that compels them to click, watch, or read further. Hooks are not about you—they're about what the reader will gain, learn, or experience.

## The 3-Step Hook Formula

This is the foundational framework for all effective hooks. Master this first.

### Step 1: Context Lean
**Purpose:** Establish topic clarity and get the reader leaning in.

**Requirements:**
- Be unmistakably clear about what the content is about (single subject)
- Get the reader to lean in using one of these methods:
  - Establish common ground
  - Reference a benefit or pain point
  - Use a metaphor to simplify complexity
  - Tell them something so interesting it blows their mind

**Example:**
> "The tech in the Vegas Sphere is insane. Biggest screen ever built—20 times bigger than an IMAX."

**Why it works:** Immediately clear subject (Vegas Sphere tech), leans in by referencing something known (IMAX) with a surprising comparison.

### Step 2: Scroll Stop Interjection
**Purpose:** Act like a stun gun—stop the reader in their tracks.

**Requirements:**
- Single line that interrupts the flow
- Use contrasting words: "but", "however", "yet", "although", "therefore", "on the other hand"
- This is the setup line for the haymaker (Step 3)

**Example:**
> "But get this—the screen is actually the least impressive part of the whole thing."

**Why it works:** Stuns the reader by contradicting the impressive claim just made. Creates tension and curiosity.

### Step 3: Contrarian Snapback
**Purpose:** The haymaker that snaps the reader in a different direction.

**Requirements:**
- Goes opposite direction of the initial lean
- Still on topic, but different path
- Bigger shock = bigger snap = better effect
- Should create an emotion-inducing or shock-driven question

**Example:**
> "Because the most impressive part is the audio. This is going to blow your mind."

**Why it works:** Completely reverses direction (screen → audio), creates shock, and promises transformation ("blow your mind").

### Complete Example

**Hook:**
> "The tech in the Vegas Sphere is insane. Biggest screen ever built—20 times bigger than an IMAX. But get this—the screen is actually the least impressive part of the whole thing. Because the most impressive part is the audio. This is going to blow your mind."

**Analysis:**
- Context Lean: Clear subject (Sphere tech), leans in with IMAX comparison
- Scroll Stop: "But get this" stuns with contradiction
- Contrarian Snapback: Reverses to audio, promises transformation

**Result:** 8 million views. Reader is fully hooked and curious.

## The Four Critical Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Single Subject, Single Question Failure

**Problem:** Hook doesn't focus on one clear subject and plant one clear question.

**Solution:**
1. Read hook back and ask: "Is it possible for someone to misunderstand the subject?"
2. Ask: "What single question should pop in the viewer's mind?"
   - Should be shock-inducing: "How is this possible?", "Is this real?", "Can you tell me more?", "I can't believe that. Is it true?"
3. **Cheat code:** Use a question hook—literally ask the question you want to plant:
   > "How can a business owner grow on YouTube without spending 40 hours per week?"

**Bad Example:**
> "Here are the three ways I grew the most last year."
- Subject unclear: growth could mean mindset, business, muscle, YouTube
- Multiple questions: "What are the three ways?", "Grew how?", "Who is this?"

**Good Example:**
> "These are the three best methods for business owners to grow faster on YouTube."
- Subject crystal clear: methods for business owners on YouTube
- Single question: "What are the methods?"

### Mistake 2: Three Hook Misalignment

**Problem:** Visual hook, spoken hook, and text hook don't align perfectly.

**The Three Hooks:**
- **Visual hook:** What's shown on screen
- **Spoken hook:** What's said verbally
- **Text hook:** Text written on top of visuals

**Solution:**
- Audit all three components: "Do all three mean the same thing?"
- If not using text hooks, start—it's way harder with just two elements
- Perfect alignment = crystal clarity = better retention

**Bad Example:**
- Spoken: "There are three methods for brushing your teeth that will prevent cavities."
- Visual: Someone eating candy
- Text: "Gum health secrets revealed"
- **Result:** Confusion, viewer misses content while figuring it out

**Good Example:**
- Spoken: "This is the future of home design."
- Visual: A home being designed
- Text: "Future of home design"
- **Result:** Perfect alignment, 2 million views

### Mistake 3: Visuals Not Unique Enough

**Problem:** Visuals don't pop off the page—not enough scroll-stopping power.

**Solution:** Use one or more of these four techniques:

1. **Attractive or unique-looking person**
2. **Recognizable person/subject** (celebrity, brand logo, something people recognize)
3. **Atypical visuals** that contrast against typical category visuals
4. **Atypical visual format/layout** (negative space, frames, overlays)

**Tactical Options:**
- Improve A-roll (talking head): Real set, studio, or green screen with static photos/compilations
- Change B-roll: Popular clips, movies, TV shows, high-quality footage different from category
- Use AI-generated visuals: Nano Banana Pro, Veo models for compelling visuals
- Build a visual reference library: Save videos that make you stop scrolling

**Key Insight:** Content world has a minimum viable visual requirement. If visuals don't cut through, people won't stop and give them a chance.

### Mistake 4: Not Using Data/Studying What Works

**Problem:** Creating hooks from scratch every time instead of studying proven winners.

**Solution:**
1. **Study your own winners first:**
   - Find your top-performing content
   - Extract hook templates
   - Save as reusable templates
   - Remix for new content

2. **Study category winners:**
   - Look at small-to-medium creators (not huge ones—their success is often brand familiarity)
   - Find creators using same visual format as you
   - Extract hook patterns from their breakouts
   - Build a library of 5-10 hook formats that perform well

**Key Insight:** Best predictor of future hook success is studying hooks that already won. Don't play on hard mode—use winners.

## Additional Tactical Tips

### Visual Hooks Are Critical

Visual hooks are 100x more powerful than spoken word alone.

**Requirements:**
1. **Text on screen:** 3-5 words in big, bold font that builds context lean
2. **Visual motion:** Enough motion to hold attention (not too much, not too little)
3. **Alignment:** Text + motion + spoken word = maximum power

**Example:**
- Text: "Future of Home Design" + "Life-Size Floor Plans"
- Visual: Home design with motion
- Spoken: "These are called life-size floor plans"
- **Result:** 15 million views

### Build Common Ground

People like hearing things they're already interested in, but open to new perspectives if they unlock benefits or solve pain points.

**Bad:**
> "You should be taking magnesium because it's one of 21 core building block minerals."

**Good:**
> "If you want better sleep, you need to be taking magnesium."

**Why:** Leads with benefit (better sleep), then introduces solution (magnesium). Even supplement skeptics will listen because sleep pain is strong.

### Cult Hopping

Wrap unknown ideas in known references to create subconscious comfort.

**Technique:** Use known brands, celebrities, movements, or cultural references as metaphors/comparisons.

**Example:**
> "How Taylor Swift's financial advisor would plan her estate around the artist earnings she just made."

**Why:** Uses known reference (Taylor Swift) to make complex topic (tax planning) accessible and comfortable.

### Compress Speed to Value

Frontload value immediately—don't bury your best stuff.

**Timeline:**
- Short-form: ~4 seconds before explosion
- YouTube: ~1-2 minutes before explosion

**Strategy:**
- Give a hit of value in the hook or right after
- Create a value loop: context → immediate value → context → immediate value
- Frontload as much as possible—super fans will watch full content

### Staccato Sentences

Make hook sentences short and punchy (staccato = short, sharp notes).

**Why:**
- Shorter sentences force maximum clarity
- Increases density of value per word
- When time is premium, increase density

**Structure:** Start short, expand to medium/long as content extends.

## Hook Writing Checklist

Use this exact process when writing hooks:

### Step 1: Pick the Subject
Get crystal clear on what the video/content focuses on. Build hook around this.

### Step 2: Decide the Question
What question should pop in the reader's head? Should be:
- Most interesting possible question
- Leads perfectly to next part of content
- Emotion-inducing or shock-driven

### Step 3: Visual Hook Sense
Have a clear vision of what the visual hook could be (don't make it yet, just envision).

### Step 4: Write the Hook
- 1-3 sentences (typically 2-3 for clarity)
- 5th grade vocabulary level
- Active voice
- Punchy delivery
- No extra words or phrases

### Step 5: One Subject, One Question Gut Check
Ask:
1. Does this hook unmistakably reference one subject?
2. Does this hook unmistakably pop one single question in the reader's mind?

If not both "yes", go back to Step 4 and rewrite.

### Step 6: Execute Visual and Text Hooks
- Make the visual hook in edit
- Add text hook on top
- Align all three pieces (spoken, visual, text)
- Gut check scroll-stop ability against competitors

### Step 7: Last Chance Audit
Watch/read the hook and answer:
1. Am I clear on what the subject is supposed to be?
2. Am I clear on what question should pop?
3. Are all three pieces perfectly aligned?
4. Am I interested and curious enough to want to continue?

If all four are "yes", you're ready.

## Five Proven Hook Types

For story-based content, use these five hook types:

### 1. Jump Into Action
Start right into action with forward momentum. Make character do anything: stepping, walking, shouting, biking.

**Example:**
> "I stood in front of my manager's office, took a big breath, knocked three times, and slowly opened the door."

### 2. Start With Dialogue
Share exact words from crucial moment.

**Example:**
> "'Mom, I've got to tell you something.' And with those words, I began a conversation that would change everything."

### 3. Pose a Question
Start with relatable question that makes listeners think about their own experience.

**Example:**
> "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to walk away from everything you've ever known and start over?"

### 4. Describe the Character
Describe unique, relatable traits that paint vivid picture.

**Example:**
> "October 2014. I was 16 years old, truck cap, long hair, baggy pants, and just covered in pimples."

### 5. Use a Cliffhanger
Start as close as possible to most crucial moment. Show the moment but don't share everything.

**Example:**
> "5 years ago I was standing in my room, letter in my hand. I knew that was it. I knew that this letter would change my life forever. Let me rewind a few hours."

## Quick Reference: Hook Quality Test

Before finalizing any hook, verify:

- [ ] **Transformation-focused:** Is this about the reader's transformation?
- [ ] **Single subject:** Is the subject unmistakably clear?
- [ ] **Single question:** Does one clear question pop in the reader's mind?
- [ ] **Three hooks aligned:** Do visual, spoken, and text hooks mean the same thing?
- [ ] **Scroll-stopping visual:** Would this make someone stop scrolling?
- [ ] **Common ground:** Does this connect to reader's interests/benefits/pain points?
- [ ] **Value frontloaded:** Is there immediate value or curiosity payoff?
- [ ] **Staccato delivery:** Are sentences short, punchy, and clear?

If all checked, the hook is ready.
