# Hook Writing Examples

## The 3-Step Formula Examples

### Example 1: Business/YouTube Growth
**Hook:**
> "There are three massive mistakes people are making with their mortgage. The average person pays an extra $122,000 per year. Most people think it's because of high interest rates. But it turns out it has nothing to do with that. Because the biggest waste of money is actually coming from..."

**Breakdown:**
- **Context Lean:** "Three massive mistakes with mortgage" + "$122,000 per year" (benefit/pain point)
- **Scroll Stop:** "But it turns out it has nothing to do with that"
- **Contrarian Snapback:** "Because the biggest waste is actually coming from..." (reverses direction)

### Example 2: Tech/Entertainment
**Hook:**
> "The tech in the Vegas Sphere is insane. Biggest screen ever built—20 times bigger than an IMAX. But get this—the screen is actually the least impressive part of the whole thing. Because the most impressive part is the audio. This is going to blow your mind."

**Breakdown:**
- **Context Lean:** Clear subject (Sphere tech) + IMAX comparison (common ground)
- **Scroll Stop:** "But get this—the screen is actually the least impressive"
- **Contrarian Snapback:** Audio is more impressive (complete reversal)

**Result:** 8 million views

### Example 3: Real Estate/B2B
**Hook:**
> "How can a business owner grow on YouTube without spending 40 hours per week? Most people think you need to post daily and create hours of content. But here's what nobody tells you..."

**Breakdown:**
- **Context Lean:** Question hook (cheat code) + benefit (time savings)
- **Scroll Stop:** "But here's what nobody tells you"
- **Contrarian Snapback:** Implies conventional wisdom is wrong

## Single Subject, Single Question Examples

### Bad Example
**Hook:**
> "Here are the three ways I grew the most last year."

**Problems:**
- Subject unclear: Growth could mean mindset, business, muscle, YouTube
- Multiple questions: "What are the ways?", "Grew how?", "Who is this?"
- Assumes embedded knowledge

### Good Example
**Hook:**
> "These are the three best methods for business owners to grow faster on YouTube."

**Why it works:**
- Subject crystal clear: Methods for business owners on YouTube
- Single question: "What are the methods?"
- No assumptions needed

## Three Hook Alignment Examples

### Perfect Alignment (Good)
**Video:** "Future of Home Design"

- **Spoken:** "This is the future of home design."
- **Visual:** A home being designed
- **Text:** "Future of home design"

**Result:** 2 million views

### Misaligned (Bad)
**Video:** Space shipping containers

- **Spoken:** "This company is sending shipping containers into space."
- **Visual:** Moon bases and rockets
- **Text:** "Space cannons are so insane"

**Problems:**
- Three different subjects (containers, bases, cannons)
- Confusion about what's actually happening
- Questions are fragmented

## Visual Hook Examples

### Example 1: Negative Space Canvas
**Creator:** Jamie Ganon (Tech Bimbo)

- Frames herself in bottom half
- Uses white walls/ceiling as negative space canvas
- Shows interesting visuals above
- **Result:** Unique visual differentiation

### Example 2: Anticipation Frames
**Creator:** Sam John Creates

- Top and bottom black frames slowly closing
- Creates anticipation
- Eye goes to it, doesn't want to scroll away
- **Result:** Visual hack that stops scrolling

### Example 3: Green Screen Enhancement
**Creator:** Unknown

- Typical green screen talking head
- Added thick white stroke outline
- Eye-catching difference
- **Result:** Stands out from typical green screen content

## Common Ground Examples

### Bad: Assumes Knowledge
**Hook:**
> "You should be taking magnesium because it's one of 21 core building block minerals."

**Problems:**
- Requires previous understanding
- Doesn't lead with benefit
- No pain point connection

### Good: Leads With Benefit
**Hook:**
> "If you want better sleep, you need to be taking magnesium."

**Why it works:**
- Leads with benefit (better sleep)
- Introduces solution (magnesium)
- Even skeptics listen (sleep pain is strong)

## Cult Hopping Examples

### Example 1: Celebrity Reference
**Hook:**
> "How Taylor Swift's financial advisor would plan her estate around the artist earnings she just made."

**Why it works:**
- Uses known reference (Taylor Swift)
- Makes complex topic (tax planning) accessible
- Creates subconscious comfort

### Example 2: Brand Reference
**Hook:**
> "The elite level of wealth that celebrities like Taylor Swift manage—here's how their financial advisors structure it."

**Why it works:**
- References known brand/person
- Wraps unknown (complex tax planning) in known
- Builds credibility through association

## Story Hook Examples

### 1. Jump Into Action
**Hook:**
> "I stood in front of my manager's office, took a big breath, knocked three times, and slowly opened the door. As I peeked in, I saw HR and my manager. I knew this wasn't good."

**Why it works:** Immediate action, forward momentum, creates tension

### 2. Start With Dialogue
**Hook:**
> "'Mom, I've got to tell you something.' And with those words, I began a conversation that would change everything."

**Why it works:** Exact words from crucial moment, creates intimacy

### 3. Pose a Question
**Hook:**
> "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to walk away from everything you've ever known and start over? That's exactly what I did when I packed my bag and moved halfway across the country."

**Why it works:** Relatable question, makes listener think about own experience

### 4. Describe the Character
**Hook:**
> "October 2014. I was 16 years old, truck cap, long hair, baggy pants, and just covered in pimples."

**Why it works:** Vivid, relatable character description, paints clear picture

### 5. Use a Cliffhanger
**Hook:**
> "5 years ago I was standing in my room, letter in my hand. I knew that was it. I knew that this letter would change my life forever. Let me rewind a few hours."

**Why it works:** Starts at crucial moment, shows but doesn't tell everything, creates curiosity
