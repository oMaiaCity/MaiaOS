# IMPORTANT: Single machine deployment required for PGlite volume persistence
# PGlite uses a single volume mounted at /data - multiple machines would cause data inconsistency
# To enforce single machine: flyctl scale count 1 --app sync-next-maia-city
# Note: Machine count is managed via flyctl scale, not in this config file

  # Use: flyctl deploy --dockerfile services/sync/Dockerfile --config services/sync/fly.toml
  # Note: dockerfile path must be specified via --dockerfile flag (relative to root)
